This repository contains code and pipelines for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system applied to NHS clinical negligence cases. It benchmarks multiple retrieval strategies (BM25, dense, hybrid, hybrid+reranker) for automated breach and causation reasoning, and provides modular evaluation tools, clustering analyses, and fully reproducible experiments to support medical NLP and healthcare AI research.
